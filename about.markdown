Just a regular guy sharing his thgouhts on .NET topics mainly.

I'm not an expert on anything, but I've been coding for over then 10 years and picked some stuff now and then.

I aspire to writing clean code, good unit tests and reasonable architecture.

GIT bash is the only option for me (yours will be too one day!).

Hope you'll enjoy my articles.
